# Providers

## Engine & Provider Selection

When `spec.engine.type` is omitted, the controller auto-selects the engine from provider capabilities. When `spec.provider.name` is omitted, the controller auto-selects a provider using CEL-based selection rules from `InferenceProviderConfig` resources. Each provider declares rules with priorities; the highest-priority match wins.

### Engine Auto-Selection

The controller selects the engine by scanning per-engine capabilities from all ready `InferenceProviderConfig` resources:

1. **Filter engines** by per-engine compatibility with the deployment:
   - GPU/CPU: each engine declares `gpuSupport` and `cpuSupport` independently
   - Serving mode: each engine declares its supported `servingModes`
2. **Rank available engines** by preference: `vllm` > `sglang` > `trtllm` > `llamacpp`
3. **Pick the first available** engine by preference

The selected engine is stored in `status.engine.type` with a reason in `status.engine.selectedReason`.

### Provider Auto-Selection

With the engine resolved, provider selection evaluates CEL rules from each `InferenceProviderConfig`:

**Default selection behavior** depends on the `InferenceProviderConfig` resources installed in the cluster. With the provider configs bundled in this repository, the shipped rules are:

```
IF gpu.count == 0 OR resources.gpu is omitted:
    → KAITO (CPU-capable provider), engine auto-selected to llamacpp when needed

IF engine == "trtllm" OR engine == "sglang":
    → Dynamo

IF engine == "llamacpp":
    → KAITO

IF mode == "disaggregated":
    → Dynamo

IF gpu.count > 1 AND engine == "vllm":
    → KubeRay

IF gpu.count > 0 AND engine == "vllm":
    → Dynamo
```

**Note:** Provider auto-selection is driven by registered `InferenceProviderConfig.selectionRules`; the core selector does not hard-code KubeRay, llm-d, or Direct vLLM. Providers with empty or no matching rules are explicit-only unless their installed config makes them selectable.

The selection reason is recorded in `status.provider.selectedReason` for observability.

## Provider Abstraction

AI Runway supports two deployment methods, both using the provider abstraction pattern:

### CRD-Based Deployment (Recommended)
Users create `ModelDeployment` CRs, and the controller + provider controllers handle the rest:
- Automatic provider selection based on capabilities
- Unified status reporting
- Provider-agnostic lifecycle management

### Web UI Deployment
The Web UI backend reads provider information (capabilities, installation steps, Helm charts) from `InferenceProviderConfig` CRDs in the cluster. These CRDs are created by **provider shims** — each provider shim must be installed (e.g., `kubectl apply -f providers/kaito/deploy/kaito.yaml`) before its provider appears in the UI. Once visible, the UI can trigger Helm-based upstream provider installation and creates `ModelDeployment` CRs for model deployment, which are then handled by the controller and provider controllers.

### KAITO Provider

The KAITO provider enables flexible inference with multiple backends:

- **vLLM Mode**: GPU inference using vLLM engine with full HuggingFace model support
- **Pre-made GGUF**: Ready-to-deploy quantized models from `ghcr.io/kaito-project/aikit/*`
- **HuggingFace GGUF**: Run any GGUF model from HuggingFace directly (no build required)
- **CPU/GPU Flexibility**: llama.cpp models can run on CPU nodes (no GPU required) or GPU nodes

| Mode             | Engine    | Compute | Use Case                         |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| vLLM             | vLLM      | GPU     | High-performance GPU inference   |
| Pre-made GGUF    | llama.cpp | CPU/GPU | Ready-to-deploy quantized models |
| HuggingFace GGUF | llama.cpp | CPU/GPU | Run any HuggingFace GGUF model   |

#### Build Infrastructure

For HuggingFace GGUF models, KAITO uses in-cluster image building:

                                            └─────────────────┘
